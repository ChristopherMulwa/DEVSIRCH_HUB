1. Project Goal & Context
We are initiating a redesign of our website's hero section. Based on extensive research, our objective is to move away from a traditional hero image and implement a more modern, effective design that enhances clarity, user engagement, and conversions.

The new hero section must achieve three things:

Instantly communicate our core value proposition.

Create a strong, memorable first impression.

Clearly guide users to our primary Call-to-Action (CTA).

This project is for a [describe your website here, e.g., "SaaS product for project management," "creative design agency portfolio," or "fintech platform"]. This context should inform your design recommendations.

2. Core Design Principles (Based on Our Research)
Please adhere to the following principles throughout the implementation process:

Clarity Over Clutter: The design must be minimalist. We will use whitespace strategically to ensure the headline and CTA are the focal points.

Visuals with Purpose: Instead of a generic photo, we will use one of the alternative visual strategies outlined below. The chosen visual must support the message, not distract from it.

Responsive and Accessible: The design must be fully responsive, providing an excellent experience on all devices, from mobile phones to large desktops. Readability is paramount, so all text must have high contrast against its background.

3. Implementation Plan & Required Actions
Please proceed through the following steps.

Step 1: Choose an Alternative Visual Strategy

Our research identified four powerful alternatives to hero images. Please propose the most suitable strategy for our website and explain your reasoning. The options are:

A. Bold Typography as the Hero: Making the headline the dominant visual element with a unique, large, and high-impact font.

Best for: Direct, confident brands with a very clear message.

B. Color & Gradients: Using a vibrant solid color or a modern gradient as the background to make the text and CTA stand out.

Best for: Minimalist brands, SaaS products wanting a clean, modern look.

C. Custom Illustration & Icons: Using scalable SVG illustrations or large icons to explain an abstract concept or add brand personality.

Best for: Tech/SaaS companies, brands wanting a friendly, approachable feel.

D. Subtle Animation & Motion: Using CSS animations or a short, looping video (e.g., product UI demo) to engage the user.

Best for: SaaS products showing functionality, creative sites wanting a dynamic feel.

Step 2: Structure the Layout & Hierarchy

Once a strategy is chosen, generate the HTML and CSS for the hero section. The structure must follow this hierarchy:

Headline (<h1>): The largest, most prominent text. It must clearly state the value proposition.

Sub-headline (<p> or <h2>): Smaller text providing supporting context.

Call-to-Action (<a> or <button>): A visually distinct button that stands out.

Use CSS Flexbox or Grid to center the content vertically and horizontally. On mobile viewports (e.g., under 768px), the layout should stack cleanly in a single column.

Step 3: Implement Responsive & Readable Design

Typography: Use responsive font size units for the <h1>, such as clamp() or vw, to ensure it scales fluidly. All other text should be perfectly legible on small screens.

Contrast: Ensure the text has a WCAG AA or AAA contrast ratio against the background. If you propose a gradient or video background, include a semi-transparent overlay to guarantee text readability.

Assets: If you recommend Strategy C (Illustration), please use the SVG format.

4. Required Output
Please provide the complete, production-ready HTML and CSS code for the new hero section. Include comments in the CSS to explain the layout, hierarchy, and responsive media queries.
